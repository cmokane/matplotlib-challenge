[!Note] After further analysis it seems that the drugs Capomlin and Ramicane performed the best when it came to to volume of the tumor inside the mice. These drugs also were tested on more mice than the others. There was basically the same amount of males and females, furthermore the gender of the mouse did not effect the drug. Infubinol was the only drug that had a outlier and according to the boxplot this drug had the highest final tumor sizes and the outlier was relatively lower than the other data from this drug. Based on the line graphs Capomulin significantly decreased the volume of a tumor in a mouse after about 45 days.The tumor volume to weight scatter plot showed that theres is a postive correlation to this distribution for Capomulin.
